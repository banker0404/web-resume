## Description

Simple web based resume made using React.js and Tailwind CSS. Inspired from web based resume by [@samunicode](https://github.com/samunicode/sameer-s_resume). Instead of using plain and boring web resume, I created a Tailwind CSS styled resume using Dracula color palette, React.js, Favicon.io, Hero Patterns, Heroicons and Font Awesome. This resume is also optimized for printing, just press CTRL + P and untick "Headers and footers" and "Background graphics" and print directly or save as PDF Document.
